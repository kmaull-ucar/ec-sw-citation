# SOFTWARE USERS

### Cite the software you use

Whether created by you or somebody else software needs citation.  The more software is cited, the more likely its creators will be acknowledged for the contribution their software has made to research, applications or wherever it is used.

### Use consistent information in your software citations

The Earth Science Informatics Partners (ESIP) citation guideline suggests your citation minimally include **_title_**, **_version_**, **_publication year_**, **_PID (DOI) URL_**, **_Publisher_**, **_author_** and **_access date_** as shown in this example:

{{% notice  info  "ESIP Example Citation Guideline" %}}
Author. (Publication Year). Title. Version No. Publisher. PID URL. Access Date.
