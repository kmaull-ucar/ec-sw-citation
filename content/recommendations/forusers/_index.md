# SOFTWARE USERS

### Cite the software you use

Whether created by you or somebody else software needs citation.  The more software is cited, the more likely its creators will be acknowledged for the contribution their software has made to research, applications or wherever it is used.

### Use consistent information in your software citations

The ESIP citation guideline suggests your citation minimally include _title_, _version_, _publication year_, _PID_, _Publisher_, _author_, _URL_ and _access date_ as shown in this example:

{{% notice  note "ESIP Example Citation Guideline" %}}
Author. (Publication Year). Title. Version No. Publisher. PID URL. Access Date.
