# SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS


There are three basic recommendations for software developers or 
maintainers of primary code repositories.  The intent of these 
recommendations are to provide an unambiguous mechanism to signal to the 
user base that the software you are providing is intended to be cited 
and that there is no room for interpretation for your citation and 
software license.

1. **Create a persistent web identifier** (such as a Digital Object 
Identifier (DOI)) for your software so that it can be appropriately 
traced, tracked, cited and maintained.

	* Please see the [detailed guidelines](./identifiers) for more information.

2. **Provide clear acknowledgement instructions** and place this 
language in the appropriate files and webpages.

	* Please review [example acknowledgements](./acknowledgements) for samples.

	
3. **Provide a license with your software** so end users understand the 
terms, conditions and intent of your software. 

	* Please review [software license information](./licenses) for additional details.
