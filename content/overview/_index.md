### EARTHCUBE SOFTWARE CITATION

As the EarthCube program concludes, these software citation recommendations are intended to provide guidance for current EC-funded software development projects on how to ensure persistent identification, citability, and discoverability for EarthCube-funded software.

It is [recognized](/resources) that software citation is under-utilized and that many excellent projects have gone under- and unrecognized because they were not appropriately cited in the contexts they were used.  In some cases, this could have been improved by explicit citation instructions provided to end users 

These recommendations also provide templates and strategies for subsequent software development projects going forward.


Please begin with the [Recommendations](/recommendations/) section to work through the recommendations for developers of software or end users.
