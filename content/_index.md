# EARTHCUBE SOFTWARE CITATION RECOMMENDATIONS


The EarthCube program is winding down and with the remaining funding for existing projects due to expire by 2024, the program office is initiating a variety of activities to assess the impact of the program to this point, as well as provide substantive and actionable guidance for the remaining projects to use as their funding ends.

Because many of the EarthCube funded projects were infrastructure and software projects, it was recognized that developing a software citation recommendation would be in the best interest of existing projects.  It was also recognized that existing projects which were not too far from their expiry might also benefit from such a recommendation.

Thus, this recommendation site was created to:

* provide guidance for current EC-funded 
software development projects on how to ensure persistent 
identification, citability, and discoverability for EarthCube-funded 
software, and 

* provide templates and strategies for 
subsequent software development projects going forward.


To learn more about these recommendations, [go to the overview](./overview/) section and begin.
