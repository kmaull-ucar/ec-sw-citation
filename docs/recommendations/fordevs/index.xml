      <description>Persistent Identifiers Three potential ways to get a persistent identifier are as follows:
Github-to-Zenodo export If you have your software in a Github repository, Zenodo provides a DOI minting service directly from Github. Zenodo extracts and archives a snapshot of your Github repository as it was at a specific time, and assigns a DOI to that snapshot. Make sure that you check the author list after exporting to Zenodo, in particular to change Github monikers to authors’ names and add ORCIDs when missing.</description>

      <description>Software Attribution &amp;amp; Acknowledgement Providing clear acknowledgement instructions to your end users required appropriate languae and file placement where end users are most likely to see it, such as your software landing page or Github README file.
Your software package’s web page or Github repository should include language indicating how you would like attribution:  The information you place on your site should provide clear instructions on how you would like your citation to appear.</description>
