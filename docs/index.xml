      <description>EARTHCUBE SOFTWARE CITATION As the EarthCube program winds down, these software citation recommendations are intended to provide guidance for current EC-funded software development projects on how to ensure persistent identification, citability, and discoverability for EarthCube-funded software.
These recommendations also provide templates and strategies for subsequent software development projects going forward.</description>

      <description>Recommendations Recommendations for software citation are made across two axis: for developers and for end users. This distinction underscores the differences between the needs of the audience and creator, where the audience (end user) needs to understand how the value of the software they use can and should be transmitted through the secondary and tertiary products of that use: research, application, publication or integration with other software.
The software creators, however, set the stage for the audience&amp;rsquo;s perception of their software&amp;rsquo;s value through a variety of means, not the least of which is the clear indication of how software should be acknowledged and situated in various contexts such as publications.</description>
